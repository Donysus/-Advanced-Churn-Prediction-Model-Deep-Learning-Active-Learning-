# -Advanced-Churn-Prediction-Model-Deep-Learning-Active-Learning-
This project implements an advanced customer churn prediction model using deep learning, hyperparameter tuning, active learning, and concept drift detection. It incorporates Ray Tune for hyperparameter optimization, SMOTE for handling imbalanced data, and an active learning system that updates the model dynamically.


## 🚀 Features
✔ Deep Learning Model: TensorFlow-based MLP with batch normalization and skip connections.
✔ Hyperparameter Optimization: Uses Ray Tune with ASHA scheduler.
✔ Data Preprocessing: SMOTE for imbalance handling and feature engineering.
✔ Active Learning System: Uncertainty-based data updates.
✔ Concept Drift Detection: Monitors changes in data distributions.
