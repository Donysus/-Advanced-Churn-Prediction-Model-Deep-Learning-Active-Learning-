# -Advanced-Churn-Prediction-Model-Deep-Learning-Active-Learning-
This project implements an advanced customer churn prediction model using deep learning, hyperparameter tuning, active learning, and concept drift detection. It incorporates Ray Tune for hyperparameter optimization, SMOTE for handling imbalanced data, and an active learning system that updates the model dynamically.
